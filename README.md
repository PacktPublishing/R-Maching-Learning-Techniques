# R Maching Learning Techniques
R Machine Learning Techniques, published by Packt Publishing

##What You Will Learn:

###Module 1, 
R Machine Learning By Example, Data science and machine learning are some of the top buzzwords in the technical world today. From retail stores to Fortune 500 companies, everyone is working hard to make machine learning give them data-driven insights to grow their businesses. With powerful data manipulation features, machine learning packages, and an active developer community, R empowers users to build sophisticated machine learning systems to solve real-world data problems. This module takes you on a data-driven journey that starts with the very basics of R and machine learning and gradually builds upon the concepts to work on projects that tackle real-world problems.
###Module 2, 
Machine Learning with R, Machine learning, at its core, is concerned with the algorithms that transform information into actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning well-suited to the present-day era of big data. Without machine learning, it would be nearly impossible to keep up with the massive stream of information. Given the growing prominence of R—a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical
programming environment—there has never been a better time to start using
machine learning. R offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of tools that can
assist you with finding data insights. By combining hands-on case studies with the essential theory that you need to understand how things work under the hood, this book provides all the knowledge that you will need to start applying machine learning to your own projects. .
###Module 3,
Mastering Machine Learning with R, The world of R can be as bewildering as the world of machine learning! There is seemingly an endless number of R packages with a plethora of blogs, websites, discussions, and papers of various quality and complexity from the community that supports R. This is a great reservoir of information and probably R's greatest strength, but I've always believed that an entity's greatest strength can also be its greatest weakness. R's vast community of knowledge can quickly overwhelm and/or sidetrack
you and your efforts. Show me a problem and give me ten different R programmers
and I'll show you ten different ways the code is written to solve the problem. As I've
written each chapter, I've endeavored to capture the critical elements that can assist
you in using R to understand, prepare, and model the data. I am no R programming
expert by any stretch of the imagination, but again, I like to think that I can provide a
solid foundation herein. Another thing that lit a fire under me to write this book was an incident that happened in the hallways of a former employer a couple of years ago. My team had an IT contractor to support the management of our databases. As we were walking and chatting about big data and the like, he mentioned that he had bought a book about machine learning with R and another about machine learning with Python. He
stated that he could do all the programming, but all of the statistics made absolutely
no sense to him. I have always kept this conversation at the back of my mind throughout the writing process. It has been a very challenging task to balance the technical and theoretical with the practical. One could, and probably someone has, turned the theory of each chapter to its own book. I used a heuristic of sorts to aid me in deciding whether a formula or technical aspect was in the scope, which was would this help me or the readers in the discussions with team members and business leaders? If I felt it might help, I would strive to provide the necessary details. I also made a conscious effort to keep the datasets used in the practical exercises large enough to be interesting but small enough to allow you to gain insight without becoming overwhelmed. This book is not about big data, but make no mistake about it, the methods and concepts that we will discuss can be scaled to big data. In short, this module will appeal to a broad group of individuals, from IT experts seeking to understand and interpret machine learning algorithms to statistical gurus desiring to incorporate the power of R into their analysis. However, even those that are well-versed in both IT and statistics—experts if you will—should be able to pick up quite a few tips and tricks to assist them in their efforts.


##What you nedd:

This software applies to all the chapters of the book:
* Windows / Mac OS X / Linux
* R 3.2.0 (or higher)
* RStudio Desktop 0.99 (or higher)
For hardware, there are no specific requirements, since R can run on any PC that has
Mac, Linux, or Windows, but a physical memory of minimum 4 GB is preferred to
run some of the iterative algorithms smoothly.
