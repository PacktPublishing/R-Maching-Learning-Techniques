# R Maching Learning Techniques
R Machine Learning Techniques, published by Packt Publishing

##What You Will Learn:

###Module 1, 
R Machine Learning By Example, Data science and machine learning are some of the top buzzwords in the technical world today. From retail stores to Fortune 500 companies, everyone is working hard to make machine learning give them data-driven insights to grow their businesses. With powerful data manipulation features, machine learning packages, and an active developer community, R empowers users to build sophisticated machine learning systems to solve real-world data problems. This module takes you on a data-driven journey that starts with the very basics of R and machine learning and gradually builds upon the concepts to work on projects that tackle real-world problems.
###Module 2, 
Machine Learning with R, Machine learning, at its core, is concerned with the algorithms that transform information into actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning well-suited to the present-day era of big data. Without machine learning, it would be nearly impossible to keep up with the massive stream of information. Given the growing prominence of R—a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical
programming environment—there has never been a better time to start using
machine learning. R offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of tools that can
assist you with finding data insights. By combining hands-on case studies with the essential theory that you need to understand how things work under the hood, this book provides all the knowledge that you will need to start applying machine learning to your own projects. .
###Module 3,
Mastering Machine Learning with R, The world of R can be as bewildering as the world of machine learning! There is seemingly an endless number of R packages with a plethora of blogs, websites, discussions, and papers of various quality and complexity from the community that supports R. This is a great reservoir of information and probably R's greatest strength, but I've always believed that an entity's greatest strength can also be its greatest weakness. R's vast community of knowledge can quickly overwhelm and/or sidetrack
you and your efforts.


##What you need:

This software applies to all the chapters of the book:
* Windows / Mac OS X / Linux
* R 3.2.0 (or higher)
* RStudio Desktop 0.99 (or higher)
For hardware, there are no specific requirements, since R can run on any PC that has
Mac, Linux, or Windows, but a physical memory of minimum 4 GB is preferred to
run some of the iterative algorithms smoothly.
